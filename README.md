This Jupyter Notebook provides an example of how to work with the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using Python and Keras. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), and it is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification and machine learning tasks.

In this project, we will cover the following key steps:

1. **Loading the MNIST Dataset**: We will show you how to download and load the MNIST dataset in Python.

2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. This includes visualizing some sample images and their corresponding labels.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data, which typically involves scaling, reshaping, and encoding labels.

4. **Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model**: We'll create a simple CNN model using Keras to classify the handwritten digits.

5. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the MNIST dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset and visualize the results.

7. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or user-provided images.
